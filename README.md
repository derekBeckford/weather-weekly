# weather-weekly

A weather application that can show you a current forecast plus a five day forecast for any city searched. Each city entered will be saved into a list that the user can click again to search for a previous city searched. 

## Weathering The Storm

One of the main challenges of this project were the fetchs to the api for specific information such as the temp, wind, and humity for the five day forecast. The API specific five day forecast shows three hour intervals within the next five days, including today. The function needs to show the temp for the next five days at noon. Another was figuring out how to send the user an error when a city they entered does not exist. 

## A Sunny Future

For future reference, I would do a temp low and high for the five day forecast so users dont just get one specific temp at noon for the next five days. It will give users a better idea of how to plan their day accordingly.
